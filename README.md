# Satellite-Tracker

This is based on https://github.com/alexchang0229/SatelliteTracker. 
This was inpired by the SatelliteTracker project (link above). 
It can track one satellite at a time, by default NOAA 19. Made to work with Adafruit Metro Airlift, but may work with other wifi feather boards. 

CAUTION!!! EXTREME BETA! Code not working yet, hpoing to finishe it by tomorrow (as of 2021-04-11).
