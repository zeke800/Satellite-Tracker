# Satellite-Tracker

This is based on https://github.com/alexchang0229/SatelliteTracker. 
This was inpired by the SatelliteTracker project (link above). 
It can track one satellite at a time, by default NOAA 19. 

CAUTION!!! EXTREME BETA (probably alpha)! Code might not work on some arduinos yet. 

USAGE:
Simply put the az/el in serial, "az,el". The motors will turn. Make sure to set the full rotation steps value!
