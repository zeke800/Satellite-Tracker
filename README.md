# Satellite-Tracker

This is based on https://github.com/alexchang0229/SatelliteTracker. 
This is the same, except is is made to work on Adafruit's line of board and uses updated libraries. Will be updated in 2 days with new code.

### Getting started
* This code was written for use with the Arduino MKR 1000 WiFi board
* You will need the following libraries: <br /> https://github.com/Hopperpop/Sgp4-Library <br /> https://github.com/arduino-libraries/RTCZero <br />
https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/
* **Place all the .INO files from this repository into the same folder on your computer, name it "tracker_main".**
* If you only want to track the ISS you can use the modified code in the trackISS branch on this repository.
* Go to tracker_main.ino and change the values under the section "to be modify by user" for your location and satellites of interest
* TLEs of satellites are obtained from Celestrak, simply copy the URL for the satellite you want (without the 'celestrak.com'),<br />
for example the international space station would be "/satcat/tle.php?CATNR=25544"
* After uploading the code to your MKR 1000, you should see something like this after opening the serial monitor: <br />

Next satellite: 1

Local time: 16/7/2020 9:17:43.00
azimuth = 199.28 elevation = -24.56 distance = 6840.21

Next satellite is: NEOSSAT in: 663

```
* Here you can verify the predictions are correct and that the local time is correct (your results will differ depending on your time/location/satellite). 
* The last few lines will continue to update over time and you should see the satellite approach. 

### Notes
* The steppers have no way of determining their positions so they assume they start at AZ = 0, EL = 20—you will have to set this up by hand.
* Do not try to power the steppers using the Arduino!
* To speed up testing, you can replace line 109 <br />
    `timeNow = rtc.getEpoch();` <br />
  with <br />
  `timeNow = testTime;` <br />
  and replace testTime with an epoch time that is just a few mins before a satellite pass.
